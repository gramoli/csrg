## Postdoc Position

The University of Sydney is recruiting a Postdoctoral Fellow to conduct and lead research in the field of distributed systems. 
The successful candidate will join the [Concurrent Systems Research Group (CSRG)](https://gramoli.github.io/csrg/) at the 
University of Sydney for one to three years to work on problems related to blockchain technologies.  

CSRG is doing research on highly secure blockchain technologies. CSRG designed the Red Belly Blockchain, a scalable blockchain 
that supports smart contracts while offering quasi-instant finality. With colleagues, it also pioneered the notion of accountable 
consensus, offered game theoretical strategies to solve consensus without 2/3 of correct participants, and built a benchmark suite 
for blockchains. Possible projects include, but are not limited to, (i) leveraging accountability, which consists of the creation 
of undeniable proofs-of-fraud to incentive good behaviours, in order to improve blockchain security; (ii) reducing unnecessary 
cryptographic verifications to maximise blockchain performance, (iii) ordering state machine replication commands and (iv) 
benchmarking blockchain technologies. Related publications can be found [here](https://gramoli.github.io/csrg/publications).

The successful candidate will have a PhD in computer science and be expected to conduct research, supervise PhD students and 
publish scientific papers in top scientific venues. Knowledge of distributed systems or distributed computing is necessary. 
An experience in game theory, cryptography, security or operating systems would be a plus.	
Expected annual salary between $107K and $117K.

To apply, please write an email to [csrg.sydney@gmail.com](mailto:csrg.sydney@gmail.com) with:
