### Diablo
[Diablo](https://diablobench.github.io/) is a benchmark to evaluate blockchain systems on the same ground. It was developed in a partnership between University 
of Sydney and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) to evaluate blockchain and distributed ledger 
technologies when running realistic applications. The name Diablo stems from DIstributed Analytical BLOckchain benchmark.

### Red Belly Blockchain
[Red Belly Blockchain](../../pubs/redbellyblockchain-oakland21.pdf) was developed in collaboration between University of Sydney and the Commonwealth Science Industry 
Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Sydney. It builds upon a formally verified deterministic consensus protocol, called the 
Democratic Byzantine Fault Tolerant (DBFT) protocol because it does rely on a leader. The name Red Belly Blockchain comes 
from a snake endemic to the Sydney region called the Red-bellied Black Snake.

### Synchrobench
[Synchrobench](https://sites.google.com/site/synchrobench/) is a micro-benchmark suite used to evaluate synchronization 
techniques on data structures. Synchrobench is written in C/C++ and Java and currently includes arrays, binary trees, 
hash tables, linked lists, queues and skip lists that are synchronized with copy-on-write, locks, read-copy-update, 
compare-and-swap and transactional memory. A non-synchronized version of these data structures is proposed in each 
language as a baseline to measure the performance gain on multi-(/many-)core machines.
